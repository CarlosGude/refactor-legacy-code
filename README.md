# refactor-legacy-code

This project is designed using the hexagonal pattern, which involves restructuring the classic Symfony directory structure.

Inside the `src` directory, we have different layers of the application:

1. `Domain`: In this layer, we have the entities and fixture generation for the different entities.
2. `Application`: In this layer, we have the different use cases, DTOs, and data transformers. All business logic is in this layer.
3. `Infrastructure`: In this layer, we have different API endpoints with autogenerated documentation. Each endpoint calls a use case from the `Application` layer. This layer is also responsible for communicating with the `Domain` layer, getting and setting data.
